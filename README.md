## Summary of Findings/Analysis (in progress)
- In the span of 4 years 53k of bookings were made, however, only about 37k which is 69.81%  customer confirmed their bookings.
- Booking that is canceled or the customers does not show up accounts about more than a quarter (1/4) of the total bookings
- Highest bookings made are from Transient customer's type, followed by Transient-Party, Contract and lastly Group
- Majority of the customers pick 'No deposit' as their deposit type, followed by 'Non refund' and 'Refundable', however, they are less significant to the 'No Deposit' majority, as the combined value of those 2 types is less than 30.
- 'Non refund' has higher pick rate amongst confirmed customer than 'Refundable' because of their total bookings (canceled or not canceled) number is higher
- Countries in europe continent has the highest amount of confirmed bookings made compared to other continents.
- Portugal has the highest confirmed bookings, 8216, followed by France (5834), while Deutschland and Great Britain,UK shares almost the same number of bookings which is above 3000 and under 3600 bookings.
- Majority of the bookings confirmed made is from new customers which represents 96.04% of the total confirmed bookings made, while only 3.96% of the customer is repeated customer across the 3 year span.
- Most bookings made were on year 2016, while the least booking made is on year 2015. Total of new customer peaked at year 2016, presumably because of the major sports event which are UEFA EURO held in France, hence there are spike in hotel bookings specifically in Europe continent.
- In scope of bookings made by **agents**, only 68.04% of total bookings were confirmed. Highest confirmed bookings were made by agent 9, followed loosely by agent 7, then agent 14.
- In scope of bookings made by **company**, only 87.74% of total bookings were confirmed. Highest confirmed bookings were made by company 40, followed by company 45 then 153

## Business suggestions (in progress)
- Maintain and improve marketing strategy for Transient customer's type as they were the highest customer's base type.
-  Implement the strategy of marketing from Transient into Transient-Party, Contract and Group customers, to replicate the same success found on Transient customers. This can include giving a discount with terms and condition, promotions with certain timeframe or periods, and provide events, attractions, services or facilities to accomodate the customer, especially on holidays.
- 'No deposit' is highly choosen as it gives them freedom and leisure to make a booking first without prior commitment or financial loss on their end.
- To increase the likelihood of customer choosing 'Non refundable' deposit type, hotel can provides certain incentives such as free meal option between breakfast or dinner and lower price for 5% or 10% discount in price because of their commitment to bookings. Hence, the amount of customer that choose 'Non refund' deposit type can be improve.
- The percentage of repeated customer is critically low which is only 3.96% and needed to be improve and increase. Suggestion to improve the low percentage of the repeated customer is to introduce a loyalty membership of the hotel and provide exclusive perks to the customer that has been to the hotel more than 1 time. Besides that, give redeemable points to the loyal customers based of their spending at the hotel in form of cashbacks or promotional price events.
